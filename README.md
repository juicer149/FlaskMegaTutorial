## Flask Mega Tutorial Project

This project follows [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), and serves as my hands-on introduction to Flask and full-stack web development.

A big thank you to Miguel Grinberg for creating such a comprehensive and approachable resource for free.

### Purpose

Until now, my programming work has mostly involved writing "raw code" — using `nvim`, running scripts via terminal, and handling data manually with SQL (MySQL). Frameworks, templating engines, ORMs, and deployment tools are all new territory for me.

Through this project, I aim to build structured knowledge in modern web development using Python and Flask.

### Learning Objectives

* **Flask** – Application structure, routing, views, and request handling.
* **Jinja2** – Templating and rendering dynamic HTML.
* **HTML/CSS** – Frontend basics to style and structure pages.
* **Database integration** – Using SQLAlchemy or another ORM to abstract database logic (coming from raw SQL background).
* **User authentication** – Managing users, logins, and sessions.
* **Deployment** – Likely on Heroku or similar service.
* **Docker** – Containerizing the app for consistency across environments.
* **Git & GitHub** – Improving my workflow and understanding of version control and collaboration.

### Project Status

I will update this README as I progress through each tutorial part and deepen my understanding.
